Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly? Not applicable, as there are no methods from other files being reused in this file.\n\n## Code Review: main.c\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It includes the \'dht22_driver.h\' file, creates a new DHT22Driver, initializes the DHT22 sensor, and reads temperature and humidity data from it.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? Yes, the code logic is correct.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"? Yes, the existing code follows the data structures and interfaces defined in the system design.\n4. Are all functions implemented? Yes, all functions are implemented.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly? Yes, methods from the \'dht22_driver.h\' file are being reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the actual logic to initialize the DHT22 sensor in the `init` function in \'dht22_driver.c\'.\n2. Implement the actual logic to read temperature data from the DHT22 sensor in the `read_temperature` function in \'dht22_driver.c\'.\n3. Implement the actual logic to read humidity data from the DHT22 sensor in the `read_humidity` function in \'dht22_driver.c\'.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

The `wiringPiSetup()`, `pinMode()` and `pullUpDnControl()` functions are already called in the `DHT22_init()` function, so they should not be called again in the `DHT22_read_temperature()` function. Instead, the `DHT22_read_temperature()` function should only read the temperature data from the sensor.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces".

Open Terminal\n2. Navigate to your project directory using \'cd\' command\n3. Initialize a new git repository (if not already done) using \'git init\'\n4. Add all files to the staging area using \'git add .\'\n5. Commit the changes using \'git commit -m "Commit message"\'\n6. Add the remote repository using \'git remote add origin <repository_url>\'\n7. Push the changes to the remote repository using \'git push -u origin master\'\n\nPlease replace <repository_url> with your actual GitHub repository URL.\n*/\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Format example 1\n## Code Review: Push updated codebase to GitHub\n1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...\n2. ...\n3. ...\n4. No, function B is not implemented, ...\n5. ...\n6. ...\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.\n   ```python\n   def handle_events(self):\n       for event in pygame.event.get():\n           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n               return False\n           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n               moved = False\n               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'UP\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'DOWN\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'LEFT\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'RIGHT\')\n               if moved:\n                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful\n                   self.render()\n       return True\n   ```\n2. Implement function B\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Format example 2\n## Code Review: Push updated codebase to GitHub\n1. Yes.\n2. Yes.\n3. Yes.\n4. Yes.\n5. Yes.\n6. Yes.\n\n## Actions\npass\n\n## Code Review Result\nLGTM\n\n\n\n# Instruction: Based on the actual code situation, follow one of the "Format example".\n\n## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n\n## Actions: Ordered List. Things that should be done after CR, such as implementing class A and function B\n\n## Code Review Result: str. If the code doesn\'t have bugs, we don\'t need to rewrite it, so answer LGTM and stop.

Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n\n## Actions: Ordered List.
